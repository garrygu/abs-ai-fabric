# CES Staff Demo Guide

**Best Practices for Introducing ABS AI Products**

---

## The 30-Second Pitch

> "This is an ABS Workstation running AI entirely locally—no cloud, no subscriptions, complete privacy. Watch this GPU ring? That's real AI inference happening right now. Everything you see—the chat, the document analysis, the visualizations—runs on this single machine."

---

## Demo Flow (Recommended Order)

### 1️⃣ **Catch Attention** (Attract Mode)
Let the Workstation Console's Attract Mode draw visitors in:
- Particle effects and GPU visualization run automatically
- Don't interrupt—let it work its magic
- When someone approaches, touch the screen to exit

### 2️⃣ **Show the Power** (Performance Screen)
- Point to the GPU utilization ring
- "See that 47%? That's real AI running right now"
- Highlight the real-time metrics

### 3️⃣ **Demonstrate AI** (Live Demo)
- Run a quick chat or document analysis
- Show the response generating in real-time
- Emphasize: "All happening locally"

### 4️⃣ **Explain the Platform** (AI Fabric)
- Show the admin interface
- "One platform to manage all AI workloads"
- Point out the installed models

### 5️⃣ **Close** (Call to Action)
- Offer spec sheet or QR code
- "Want to see it run your workload?"

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't get too technical** — Save deep dives for interested parties

❌ **Don't block the screen** — Let people see the visuals

❌ **Don't interrupt Attract Mode** — It's designed to draw people in

❌ **Don't make promises about specs** — Refer to official materials

❌ **Don't compare directly to competitors** — Focus on our strengths

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "Is this just running ChatGPT?"**
> No, this runs open-source models like Llama 3 and DeepSeek entirely locally. No cloud connection at all.

**Q: "How much does it cost?"**
> It's part of the ABS Workstation. No recurring subscription fees for the AI software.

**Q: "What models can it run?"**
> Any Ollama-compatible model—Llama 3, Mistral, DeepSeek, CodeLlama, and many more. The GPU VRAM determines the max model size.

**Q: "Can we train our own models?"**
> This platform is optimized for inference. Training typically requires different hardware, but fine-tuned models can be deployed here.

**Q: "Does it need internet?"**
> No. Once set up, it works completely offline.

**Q: "How hard is it to set up?"**
> Pre-configured on ABS Workstations. Turn it on and it's ready.

## Emergency Procedures

### If the demo freezes:
1. Refresh the browser (F5)
2. If still frozen, restart the app: close terminal, run `npm run dev`
3. Call for technical support

### If someone asks something you don't know:
1. "Great question—let me get our technical specialist"
2. Take their contact info for follow-up
3. Don't guess

### If Attract Mode won't start:
1. Wait 60 seconds of no interaction
2. Check that GPU metrics server is running
3. Ensure browser supports WebGPU (Chrome/Edge)
